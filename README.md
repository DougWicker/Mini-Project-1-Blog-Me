# Mini Project 1 - BlogMe
This mini project focuses on sentiment and keyword analysis for Blog Me, a blogging website.

#### Project brief:
The project bried was as follows: BlogMe, a famous blogging business has a dataset of news articles that they need further analysis on. Firstly, theyâ€™d like keywords to be extracted from headlines of the article. Secondly, they would need to determine the sentiment of the news articles. The data is in an excel sheet and they would like to see a dashboard outlying sentiment, top articles etc.

#### How:
I used a Natural Language Processing Library called Vader in Python to perform sentiment analysis. After extracting the data to Tableau, I performed Tableau joins, worked with sets and context filtering, and created an interactive dashboard.
